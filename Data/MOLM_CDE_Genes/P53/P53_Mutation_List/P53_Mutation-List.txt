##ReadME for both the P53_Mutation Hotspots files::

We tested the top four most frequent p53 mutation hotspots in our cell line: 743G>A, 742C>T, 818G>A, 524G>A (Mtuation Details in the end.) 

We designed a test to see the whether this mutation individually can show the effect statistically significant shown considering all the mutations together.

To find the specific mutation induced to create a isogenic cell pair, we tested the effects of top four P53 Mutation hotspots by frequency in our cell lines: 743G>A, 742C>T, 818G>A, 524G>A.
Still, due to a limited frequency range of 7 to 12 cell lines, we lack the statistical power to test them individually. This is due to very strict FDR correction across ~14000 genes.
Hence, to overcome this, we chose an abstract significance threshold of  p.(withour-fdr-correction)<0.1 to test the effect of each p53 variant. Our aim is the test CRISPR-specific differentially essential for each genes across a given p53 mutant variant compared to WT.

We found two out of the four variants, 743G>A and 742C>T, show the desired effect.
743G>A showed the effect when MOLM13 is compared with rest of the cell lines with this p53 variant(n=12), where DE+/- of CRISPR screenings were ~700 and ~380, where the CDE+/- of shRNA is balanced. (~1000) (Chi Square P< 1.3E-76) Here, the CDE-Pos/Neg are enriched with the previously found in manuscript. (Hypergeometric(HG) P< 4.1E-21 and P< 4.0E-4)

742C>T showed the effect when all the wild type cell lines are compared with rest of the cell lines with this p53 variant (n=7), where DE+/- of CRISPR screenings were ~1600 and ~1280 where the CDE+/- of shRNA is balanced. (~2000) (Chi Sq P<2.6E-78) Here as well, the CDE-Pos/Neg are enriched with the previously found in manuscript. (Hypergeometric(HG) P< 1.9E-140 and P<4.9E-60)
