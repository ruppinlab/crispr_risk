##ReadME for both the CDE_Negative files::

MOLM13 specific CDE- are also highly enriched in CDE- found in manuscript. (In accordance of report, for control (i): hyper-geometric p<0.02 and  for control (ii): p<2.5E-12 ))

First file contains a union of CDE_neg genes found using control (i) and (ii). This is a total of 42, hence, we further listed and ranked rest of the CDE- genes found previously in manuscript in order of their effect size.
*For the purpose of designing a fluorescence assay to show selection, you could use the top ~10 genes from table S2A.
*For the purpose of designing a NGS-seq after CRSIPR experiment, you can take table S2A genes(42) and then, top 58 genes from table S2B.
