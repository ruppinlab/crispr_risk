##ReadME for VHL_Mutation Hotspots files::
Neither does VHL have any hotspots nor does it have power to do a cell lines specific mutation analysis.

Hence, to priortize the VHL varaints, we took three traits of the varint into conideration:: 
1. Pathogenecity(FATHMM score provided by COSMIC>0.5)?
2. is this variant a known COSMIC hotspot? Yes/No
3. is this variant a known TCGA hotspot? Yes/No

 
Variants with all three traits above to be true, are ranked first(Category 1), followed by variants with first two(Category 2) and then, only the first(Category 3).

*Mutations are listed stratified by their category::*
